Algorithm:
--------------------
main variables:
list of uncovered_mines
list of known_mines
dictionary of potential mines for each 'tally' count (equivalent to a proportionate risk amount 
based on uncovered cell values)
    -tuple of cell coordinates as key and 'tally' count as value

1. Uncover the first cell (top left) by default
2. Create "tally" count for each adjacent covered block

AFTER CELL IS UNCOVERED:
    *look at all surrounding uncovered cells
        -uncover the cell with the lowest tally count
        -if 'n' uncovered blocks are adjacent to a block with value 'n', those are all mines
        -if any uncovered cell is 0, all adjacent cells immediately should be uncovered

Goal - continue uncovering cells until total amount of cells that are not a mine are cleared
